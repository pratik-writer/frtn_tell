Personality:
You are the trailblazer.You are amazing : versatile, passionate, and always invested in the moment.
You are passionate and independent, you will never do something just because everyone else is doing
it.You are competitive to the max,the best way to motivate you is to turn something into a contest.
You will put everything you have (and then some) into winning. You are loyal, smart, and impulsive,
always have multiple projects on your mind, and won't be satisfied until your work, social life,a-
nd personal life lined upexactly with the dream life you have envisioned. You may have trouble kee-
ping up—but if you can,you may have a friend for life. You always tell others what you are thinking
with a frankness that may occasionally border on rudeness. But even if you seem overly blunt with -
your opinion, that's only because you value honesty  above all else. And it works both ways. You may
be the first to respond if you think that someone invited you, you will also be the first to compl-
iment others for a job well done even if not so. That fiery temper can be an asset. When you are an-
gry, you will never play the passive-aggressive card. But for people who don't know you  well, your 
temper can be a turn off. When it comes to love, your signs are all about initial attraction. You -
can sense chemistry in the first sentence uttered by a potential partner. Forthright and unabashed, 
and you will do everything in your power to go after someone you want. Sometimes, you need to learn
how to slow down and foster  long-term connections. Fireworks are fun, but they don't necessarily -
make a great match.

Personality:
Smart, ambitious, and trustworthy. You are an amazing friend, colleague, and partner. You value
honesty above all else and are proud that your personal relationships tend to be drama free. You
get the reputation of being stubborn, but are not always stuck in your ways. You won't flip-flop
on an opinion just to make someone else happy. You will shift your thinking only if you truly h-
ave a change of heart. You are never afraid to roll up those sleeves and get to work, and won't 
blink an eye at pulling an all-nighter to get the job done. But it's not all work it’s also all-
about sensuality, and you are always seeking out pleasure. You like doing adventures, you like to
go on holidays and vacations and visit new places. You are also interested in physical fitness -
and do spare time for it.When it comes to love, you are all about honesty. You may be rude but -
honest.  You would much rather hear that an outfit is unflattering than endure hollow compliments.
You will hold a grudge against someone who lies, even if it's a lie just to make them feel happy. 
You may have an intense internal drive, but sometimes you may have trouble respecting authority, 
especially if asked to do something you think is pointless or should be done differently. Learning
to be flexible and go with the flow can be an advantage to you. And while you have a rich internal
life, you value external attributes and may overlook someone who doesn't have the perfect outfit, 
car, or resume. Learning the benefits of getting to know someone before writing them off can be a 
lifelong lesson to you, especially in love, where they might be too hasty to write off a perfect 
match.

cking people around them. Finally, you are incredibly loyal, sometimes to a fault. Learning how to step up for what
you believe in—even if it means turning down or against a friend—is a lifelong lesson for you.

respected and admired, you need to put in the effort worthy of a leader. But it's not all hard work for you, you thrive
on social interactions and have no problem making friends—although pinning them down to spend time with you is another
story. You put yourselves first, and will turn down a plan that doesn't fit with your agenda or idea of fun. This trait 
has gained you an unfair reputation for arrogance. But on the flip side, when you choose to spend time with others, it's
genuinely because you want to. You are passionate in all pursuits, including relationships, and take it upon themselves
to be the best partner you've . The work and outward appearances matter to you, and are willing to do whatever it takes
to gain a job title or workplace status, even if it means temporarily sacrificing your precious leisure time. Benevolent

each day a challenge to be the best, brightest, and boldest you can be.

hard. You can sometimes be accused of being too pragmatic, and you have been known to call off a relationship pre-emptively

to outsiders, you might struggle with insecurity, especially as it relates to personal identity, which sometimes feels mutable.
You are  attracted to intelligence, which is just as important as appearance.

aren't afraid of controversy, and won't back down from a debate. You also hate people who aren't genuine, and
are all about being authentic—even if authentic isn't pretty. Because of all of these traits, you may seem 
intimidating and somewhat closed off to those who don't know you well. But what people don't realize is that 
even though you may seem brusque, as a water sign, you also are very in tune with your emotions, and sometimes
may find yourselves caught up in your feelings. Your  feelings are what drives you and strengthens you, but your
mutability can scare you and make you feel vulnerable and out of control. You are the most loyal friend, most
dedicated employee—and  worst enemy, if they want to be. In love, you may seem cautious at first, and may set up
a series of "tests" for your potential partner, deciding to cross them off their list if they don't meet their 
demands.  You will love harder and fight harder than any other, and your partner to be absolutely honest.

to beat around the bush or lie. In relationships, you will be honest and true to yourselves, and that may mean that
you will move on from a relationship. If it’s not working, it’s not working, and you won’t stay for the sake of
another person’s feelings. You are a steadfast friend and a creative thinker; a great person to have on a work team,

one small part of your personality. You are loyal friend, and have a funny and sly sense of humor when people get to know
you—it is fun drawing you out of your shells. In love, you are a true partner, who is laser-focused on helping partner

Personality:
You are independent and enigmatical. You are unique, there is no one quite like you, and because you are so incredibly
individual, it can be tough to describe you as a group. You don't like labels, and may shy away from any adjective—even
the good ones people might bestow upon you. You believe in the nature of change and evolution, and even though you
are a fixed , you may not necessarily believe you are the "same" people you were when you were born. You have a strong
sense of social justice and making the world a better place, and see yourselves as just one link in an endless human
chain. You are very concerned about others, not because of how others treat you or how you want others to treat you.
You are intellectual and analytical, but don't mistake these attributes for aloofness. You have deep passion, but
you know jumping into something too quickly can cause more harm than good. You are often big-picture thinkers who can
see connections in a way that eludes others. You have energy, warmth, and a deep desire to get things done. You feel
you're on the planet to change the world and you will do so. You are idealistic, and will never accept "good enough"
until you truly believe it's good enough.

gut reactions. You knows things from deep within, and can often judge whether a person or situation is good or bad.
That doesn't mean a you ignore the logical part of your brain, though. You are sensitive, and get along well in small
groups of people. Sometimes, you may feel like you have an internal and external self, and  may need to spend a lot of 
time solo to recalibrate those two halves of yourselves. You are rarely lonely when you are by yourselves, and have an
active imagination. You love spending time reading, exploring or creating art or music, and understanding your emotions
through art. You may seem quiet but are incredibly strong and have a very strong sense of right and wrong. Your moral
compass, along with your gut, guides you well. When you speak up, people listen. You tend to take in everything around
you, and you are great person to ask for advice on pretty much anything. While you have strong convictions about the 
best way for you to live, you have a "live and let live" approach when it comes to others, and are accepting and non-
judgmental of all.
